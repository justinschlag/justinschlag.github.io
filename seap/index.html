      <p>
        As a SEAP intern at NIWC Atlantic in Charleston, SC, I worked across two labs focused on secure communication infrastructure and mobile application development. My internship provided direct experience supporting U.S. defense efforts through international military sales and DoD software platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began in the <strong>Foreign Military Sales Lab</strong>, where I configured laptops with LINK-16 for secure communications across five countries, prepared and packaged over a dozen server racks for export, and supported U.S.-Morocco communications amid Algerian regional threats. I later transitioned to the <strong>Mobile Applications Lab</strong>, where I improved user workflows on the STEMRocks platform and helped build a document center with React.js to simulate onboarding procedures for service members.

      <h2>What I Did</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Configured foreign laptops with LINK-16 for secure international communication.</li>
        <li>Prepared 15 server racks using CAD layouts and secured systems for overseas shipment.</li>
        <li>Enabled communication between Morocco and U.S. personnel facing Algerian threats.</li>
        <li>Improved training UX on stemrocks.net by analyzing user behavior and site metrics.</li>
        <li>Developed a document center interface using React.js, HTML, and task-list logic.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        This internship gave me real-world exposure to international defense operations, CAD-based equipment planning, and modern front-end development in a mission-critical setting. I left with new technical fluency, greater confidence collaborating in federal teams, and a deeper commitment to serving through secure, innovative engineering.
