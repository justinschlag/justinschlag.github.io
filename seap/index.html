    <p>
      As a SEAP intern at NIWC Atlantic, I gained early exposure to Department of Defense research workflows and engineering collaboration. I worked closely with civilian engineers to assist in secure systems prototyping and learned the foundations of system lifecycle processes within a real Navy lab.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Assisted with lab hardware setups and documented test configurations.</li>
      <li>Observed cybersecurity tool demonstrations and basic script walkthroughs.</li>
      <li>Participated in facility tours and collaborative STEM sessions with other interns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The experience solidified my interest in working in national security engineering and helped me build initial soft skills and technical confidence through hands-on exposure in a federal R&D setting.
