      <p>
     I am actively involved in research focused on improving computer vision in challenging weather conditions. I developed an image segmentation application that identifies and masks raindrops on camera lenses, which strengthens the overall object detection pipeline used in our project. Each week, I meet with my professor and fellow researchers to collaborate on ongoing progress and new approaches, and I also work closely with our industry partner, Integer Technologies. Additionally, I participate in quarterly reviews with the Office of Naval Research (QPR meetings), where we present our results and align with long-term research goals. Through this work, I contribute directly to advancing real-world applications of AI by ensuring cleaner datasets that improve detection performance in rainy environments.
