      <h2>How JustinBot Works – A Deep Dive</h2>
      <p>
        JustinBot isn’t just a chatbot—it's a full-stack, interactive application combining real-world deployment, machine learning, and dynamic frontend development. Here’s how the system comes together:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Assistant API (the AI Brain):</strong>
          JustinBot leverages OpenAI’s Assistant API, which provides responses based on a finely tuned language model. This model has been trained on a wide variety of topics and is further specialized to represent my background and experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Node.js Server (the Middleman):</strong>
          The frontend doesn’t connect directly to OpenAI. Instead, a Node.js server acts as a secure intermediary. When you ask a question, the request is sent to my backend, which reformats it, sends it to the Assistant API, then returns the result as a clean reply.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hosted on Render:</strong>
          This server is hosted on Render, a scalable platform that keeps the service low-cost but always available. Because it scales dynamically, the first request may take up to 30 seconds—hence the sleeping message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frontend Chat Interface (the Presentation Layer):</strong>
          Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the UI is responsive, styled professionally, and dynamically updates content without page reloads. It’s designed to be fast, accessible, and mobile-friendly.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> JustinBot demonstrates both the ability to deploy real-world AI solutions and to explain technical work clearly. It combines backend logic, frontend engineering, deployment infrastructure, and conversational UX—key skills in modern engineering.
