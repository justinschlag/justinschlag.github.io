    <h2>🧠 How JustinBot Works</h2>
    <p>
      JustinBot is powered by <strong>OpenAI's Assistant API</strong> and runs on a <strong>Node.js server hosted with Render</strong>. It's a custom AI assistant trained with info about my work, personality, and interests. Here's how it all works:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Assistant API:</strong> The brain behind the bot! I created a personalized assistant using OpenAI's platform, which handles responses to questions in a conversational way.</li>
      <li><strong>Node.js Backend:</strong> When you submit a question, a Node.js server sends your message to OpenAI, waits for the reply, then delivers it back to the site.</li>
      <li><strong>Render Hosting:</strong> The backend is hosted on <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">Render</a>. It spins up when needed, which is why JustinBot might take a few seconds to "wake up."</li>
      <li><strong>Frontend Chat:</strong> The chatbox on this page is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches answers in real-time and updates the page without reloading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To make things fun, the first message you send shows a playful note: <em>“JustinBot is sleeping... please allow up to thirty seconds while he wakes up ☕💤”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I built JustinBot as a way to explore AI integration and make my portfolio more interactive—it's a mix of backend logic, frontend design, and OpenAI magic!
