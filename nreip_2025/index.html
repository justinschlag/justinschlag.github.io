    <p>
      As a NREIP intern at NIWC Atlantic, I collaborated with research teams to contribute to mission-critical projects involving AI, image segmentation, and machine learning tools. My work focused on improving detection accuracy in edge computing environments.
    </p>

    <h2>My Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a prototype image segmentation tool for object identification using Python and OpenCV.</li>
      <li>Tested and tuned YOLOv7 models on limited datasets in edge-simulated environments.</li>
      <li>Produced detailed internal reports and presented findings to division mentors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skills Gained</h2>
    <p>
      I deepened my experience in computer vision, Git-based collaboration, and DoD lab environments. This role directly shaped my passion for scalable, secure AI tools in defense systems.
