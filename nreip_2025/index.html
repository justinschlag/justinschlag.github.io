    <p>
      As a NREIP intern at NIWC Atlantic during Summer 2025, I work under a computer engineer in the Air Traffic Control (ATC) division. I assist with ongoing projects that support aviation safety and communications infrastructure for military operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hold an active security clearance, and due to the confidential nature of the work in ATC systems, I am limited in the technical details I can share. However, this role has given me exposure to real-world defense engineering workflows and critical systems integration.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Update</h2>
    <p>
      I’m currently involved in Air Traffic Control systems at NIWC Atlantic. I support engineering projects that contribute to the safety and reliability of military air operations. While the specifics are classified, I’m gaining firsthand experience working in a secure, mission-critical environment under the guidance of seasoned engineers.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills Gained</h2>
    <p>
      Through this internship, I’ve gained insight into government engineering processes, secure system operations, and technical documentation protocols in a defense setting.

<!-- Airfield Lighting Control GUI Integration
During my NREIP internship at NIWC Atlantic, I developed a real-time graphical interface for the Airfield Lighting Control System (AFLCS) using Python and Modbus TCP/IP.

I engineered a two-way synchronization solution between a custom GUI panel and actual airfield hardware. My responsibilities included:

Designing and implementing a Tkinter-based control panel that visually represents lighting, switches, and rotary controls, accurately reflecting the physical airfield lighting hardware.

Integrating with Modbus protocols to enable real-time communication between the software GUI and the AFLCS hardware—ensuring that changes made physically (on the hardware) are immediately shown on screen, and that user actions in the GUI control the real system.

Troubleshooting networking and IP configuration, working directly with the physical system via static IP assignment and direct hardware interfacing.

Automating hardware polling and command delivery using asynchronous techniques, ensuring robust, low-latency updates between the digital and physical systems.

This project gave me hands-on experience with industrial controls, networked systems, and embedded interface development. It also honed my skills in problem-solving and working closely with engineers to bridge the gap between software and real-world hardware.
