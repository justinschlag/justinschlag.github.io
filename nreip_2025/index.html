      <h2>Internship Overview</h2>
      <p>
        During Summer 2025, I served as an Air Traffic Control (ATC) Engineering Intern at NIWC Atlantic in Charleston, SC. With an active Secret Security Clearance, I contributed to mission-critical projects designed to enhance airfield safety, communications, and system reliability for military operations. I was awarded a stipend through the South Carolina Internship Program (SCIP), recognizing my work in a high-demand engineering field.
