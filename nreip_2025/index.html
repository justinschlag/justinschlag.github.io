    <p>
      As a NREIP intern at NIWC Atlantic during Summer 2025, I work under a computer engineer in the Air Traffic Control (ATC) division. I assist with ongoing projects that support aviation safety and communications infrastructure for military operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hold an active security clearance, and due to the confidential nature of the work in ATC systems, I am limited in the technical details I can share. However, this role has given me exposure to real-world defense engineering workflows and critical systems integration.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Update</h2>
    <p>
      I’m currently involved in Air Traffic Control systems at NIWC Atlantic. I support engineering projects that contribute to the safety and reliability of military air operations. While the specifics are classified, I’m gaining firsthand experience working in a secure, mission-critical environment under the guidance of seasoned engineers.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills Gained</h2>
    <p>
      Through this internship, I’ve gained insight into government engineering processes, secure system operations, and technical documentation protocols in a defense setting.
